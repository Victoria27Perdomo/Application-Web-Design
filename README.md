### What is Markdown used for

Markdown is a markup language used mainly for documentation on repositories like GitHub or GitLab; it's main purpose its to allow users to add formatting elements to plain text without
the need to use a a text editor or HTML tags, for example, instead of using an HTML tag like "h1" for a heading, we can use a hash symbol instead, allowing us to implement the same 
functions with more simplicity, making it useful due to the nature of documentation files, which more often than not tends to be quite extensive, making the Markdown language far more 
practical to use.
